## Hi! I'm Urvi

I'm a neuroscience enthusiast based in Mumbai, India. I am currently pursuing my Master's at Tata Institute of Fundamental Research studying cell-fate specification in early neurodevelopment. I've also developed a healthy interest in learning techniques of analysis employed in computational neruoscience. 

I like to read, write, game and occassionaly tell tales of my cat's adventures .
